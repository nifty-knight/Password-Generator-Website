# Password-Generator-Website
Password Generator Website which allows the user to pick topics; it then scrapes https://relatedwords.org/ for words related to a random topic from the user's list and combines them with symbols and numbers to produce a password in the pattern word-verb-word or adj-word-word. The idea is to produce passwords which are longer to type, but are also more memorable and more secure. Main page is main.php.

This project uses PHP, HTML, CSS (barely), and SQL, and was run on an Apache server during development.
This was made Nov 2023- Apr 2024 as a Grade 12 project for fun. Very surprised that I finished.
