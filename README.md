# Password-Generator-Website
Password Generator Website which allows the user to pick topics; it then scrapes https://relatedwords.org/ for words related to a random topic from the user's list and combines them with symbols and numbers to produce a password in the pattern word-verb-word or adj-word-word. The idea is to produce passwords which are longer to type, but are also more memorable and more secure. Test your passwords with https://www.passwordmonster.com/. Download files and open Main.php to run.

This project uses PHP, HTML, CSS (just a bit of bootstrap), and SQL, and was run on an Apache server during development.
This was made Nov 2023- Apr 2024 as a Grade 12 project for fun. Very surprised that I finished. :)
